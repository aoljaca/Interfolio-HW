1. What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?

    I used Angular material because it provided ready made components for 
    my angular project.

2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
    
    I would add more styling to the project and seperate it into more components 

3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

    I am most proud of the project in its entirety because I have
    not worked with Angular professionally before. 

4. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult

    I spent the most time on setting up the grid. I was new to how Angular material
    grid functions compared to Vuetifys.
